Snake Game - Python Project
A simple Snake Game built using Python's Turtle graphics library as part of the 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp. This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake to eat food while avoiding collision with the walls and its own body.

Features:
  Animated snake movement with keyboard controls (up, down, left, right).
  Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer with each food item consumed.
  Game over detection upon collision with walls or the snake's own body.
  Clean and modular code structure using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Technologies Used:
  Python 3: Core programming logic.
  Turtle Library: For graphical rendering and animation.
  OOP Principles: Used for handling the snake, food, and game logic.
How to Run:
  Clone the repository to your local machine.
  Run main.py in your Python environment.
  Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
Future Improvements:
  Add levels or difficulty modes.
  Implement a scoring system and leaderboard.
  Include sound effects for a more immersive experience.
